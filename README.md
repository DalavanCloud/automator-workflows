A collection of Automator workflows that speed up your design / development process.

## Add @2x Suffix.workflow

## Convert Image Format.workflow
Convert selected images to specific format.

## Copy & Add @2x Suffix.workflow

## Create @2x Image.workflow

**Note**: Export your image slices in retina size, WITHOUT `@2x` suffix.
